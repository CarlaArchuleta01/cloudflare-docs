# Use virtual networks to change user egress IPs

{{<Aside type="note">}}

Only available on Enterprise plans.

{{</Aside>}}

This tutorial gives administrators an easy way to allow their users to change their egress IP address between any of your assigned dedicated egress IP addresses. Your users can choose which egress IP to use by switching virtual networks directly from in the WARP client.

Changing egress IPs can be useful in quality assurance (QA) and other similar scenarios in which users both use their local egress location and either switch to or simulate other remote locations.

{{<tutorial>}}

{{<tutorial-prereqs>}}

Make sure you have:

- [Deployed the WARP client](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/deployment/) on your users' devices.
- [Configured tunnels](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/) to connect your private network to Cloudflare. This tutorial assumes you have:
  - Created two tunnels.
  - Routed `10.0.0.0/8` through one tunnel.
  - Routed `192.168.88.0/24` through the other tunnel.
- Received multiple [dedicated egress IP addresses](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/).

{{</tutorial-prereqs>}}

{{<tutorial-step title="Create a virtual network for each egress route">}}

1. Create a [virtual network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/) corresponding to one of your dedicated egress IPs. For example, this virtual network will correspond to an egress location in North America.

    ```sh
    $ cloudflared tunnel vnet add vnet-AMER
    ```

2. Configure your virtual network to use the entire internal IP range of your private network and assign the corresponding tunnel.

    ```sh
    $ cloudflared tunnel route ip add --vnet vnet-AMER 10.0.0.0/8 tunnel-AMER
    $ cloudflared tunnel route ip add --vnet vnet-AMER 192.168.88.0/24 tunnel-AMER
    ```

3. Repeat Steps 1-2 for each dedicated egress IP you want users to switch between.

{{</tutorial-step>}}

{{<tutorial-step title="Create an egress policy">}}

Next, assign your dedicated egress IPs to each virtual network using Gateway egress policies.

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Egress Policies**.
2. Select **Add a policy**.
3. Name your policy. We recommend including the country or region traffic will egress from.
4. Add the virtual network with the _Virtual Network_ selector. For example:

    | Selector        | Operator | Value       |
    | --------------- | -------- | ----------- |
    | Virtual Network | is       | _vnet-AMER_ |

5. In **Select an egress IP**, choose **Use dedicated Cloudflare egress IPs**. Choose the dedicated IPv4 and IPv6 addresses you want traffic to egress with.
6. Select **Create policy**.
7. Repeat Steps 1-6 to create a separate egress policy for each virtual network you created.

{{</tutorial-step>}}

{{<tutorial-step title="Test virtual network egress">}}

1. On your user's machine, log in to your Zero Trust organization in the WARP client.
2. In a terminal, run the following command to check the default egress IP address.

    ```sh
    $ curl ifconfig.me -4
    ```

    The command should output your organization's default egress IP.

3. In the WARP client, select the gear icon > **Virtual Networks**. Choose a virtual network you created.
4. Check the egress IP address by running `curl ifconfig.me -4` again. The command should output the IP address specified in your egress policy.

While your users are connected to a virtual network, their traffic will route via the dedicated egress IP specified. You can repeat these steps to test that each virtual network is egressing from the correct IP.
